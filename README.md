# Cooperative-Load-Transportation-With-Two-Quadrotors-Using-Reinforcement-Learning
The Synchronous Quadcopter Control project aims to synchronize two carrier quadcopters to move a rod from the origin to the destination. The project utilizes deep curriculum reinforcement learning techniques to train the quadcopters to perform this task in a synchronized manner while maintaining balance.

# Project Specifications 
- Agents exist in an environment with intersections, seas, and gates as targets.
- Each road in the intersection is 60 meters long, with a gate as the goal at the end.
- Quadcopters are connected to a two-meter-long rod in the center of the intersection.
- The agents' task is to move the rod from the starting point to the targets while maintaining balance and avoiding the ground or sea.
- The quadcopters must simultaneously lower the bar height to land next to the target after reaching each gate.
