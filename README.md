# Cooperative-Load-Transportation-With-Two-Quadrotors-Using-Reinforcement-Learning
This project aims to synchronize two carrier quadcopters to move a rod from the origin to the destination. The project utilizes deep curriculum reinforcement learning techniques to train the quadcopters to perform this task in a synchronized manner while maintaining balance.
